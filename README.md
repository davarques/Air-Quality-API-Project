# Air Quality Analysis 
## for Business Operation Offices

## Context
Tech companies often outsource aspects of their workforce (sales, support, operations, etc.) to external firms known as vendor partners to scale up operations.

## Current Scenario
We are operating in two Asian locations (India 🇮🇳 and the Philippines 🇵🇭).

## Problem Statement
- Investigate the current air quality ♻️ of our operating locations.
- Explore potential new locations 🏢 with similar costs and better air quality.

## Data Sources Used
1. **Air Quality API**
   - Source: [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/air-quality)
   - Parameters: City name, Longitude, Latitude
   - Results: Multiple air quality indexes including AQI, PM2.5, and O3 levels.

2. **Kaggle Datasets**
   - [World Cities Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/max-mind/world-cities-database?select=worldcitiespop.csv)
   - [Global Country Information 2023](https://zenodo.org/records/8165229)

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / Metrics
- Minimum Wage (in USD $)
- Unemployment Rate (%)
- Gross Primary Education Enrollment (%)

## Hypotheses
### Hypothesis 1:
The air quality in our current cities (Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Manila) is unhealthy or dangerous. Exploring new locations with better air quality is a good idea.

### Hypothesis 2:
We can discover new locations to open offices that offer better air quality than our current sites (India and the Philippines) with similar labor costs, so we don't have to sacrifice much budget.

## Conclusions and Insights
### Hypothesis 1:
- Two-thirds of our current locations are unhealthy 😷, and one-third is dangerous ☠️ in terms of Air Quality.
- If air quality is a crucial factor for our next location, exploring new places is worthwhile.

### Hypothesis 2:
- Overall African countries 🌍 look like a good alternative 🔄 to explore, offering better air quality ♻️ while keeping costs 💰comparable to the Asian locations. (Examples: Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar ⭐, or Togo)

## Project Limitations ⚠️
- Air quality and labor costs (minimum wage, unemployment rate, and education) are not the only factors to consider when deciding new locations.
- This study is not definitive or final. Other factors, such as political stability, conflicts, or resources, could significantly influence the decision-making process when exploring new locations in Africa.
